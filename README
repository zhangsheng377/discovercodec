README:
-------
DISCOVER-codedc consists of an encoder and decoder to compress video data based
on the Distributed Video Coding principles.
The software with test data can be downloaded at http://www.discoverdvc.org
For questions, notes and bug reports please contact klomp@tnt.uni-hannover.de


Files:
------
H264encoder.exe                - H264 Intra codec (http://iphome.hhi.de/suehring/tml)
discoverdec                    - DISCOVER-decoder
discoverenc                    - DISCOVER-encoder
foreman_176x144_15_orig_01.yuv - QCIF test sequence
foreman_decoder.cfg            - Decoder configuration
foreman_encoder.cfg            - Encoder configuration
foreman_keyframe.cfg           - Sequence dependend configuration for the Intra codec
h264.cfg                       - H264 Intra codec configuration
ldpcmatrices/                  - Matrices for LDPC coding


Encoding:
---------
The encoder can be executed by calling:
  discoverenc foreman_encoder.cfg

All parameters within the configuration file can also be set as commandline parameter:
  discoverenc --Qindex=4 foreman_encoder.cfg


Decoding:
---------
The decoder can be executed by calling:
  discoverdec foreman_decoder.cfg

All parameters within the configuration file can also be set as commandline parameter:
  discoverdec --FrameRate=15 foreman_decoder.cfg


Output:
-------
bitstream.wz - Bitstream containing the LDPC bits and further configuration information (e.g. frame width and height)
data.txt - Unused output from the H.264 Intra codec
foreman_decoded01.yuv - Decoded sequence, the number represents the quantisation index
foreman_keyf_infoQ1.txt - PSNR and rate results for the key (intra) frames. Used to calculate the total bitrate and the average PSNR of the coded sequence.
foreman_keyf_infoQ1.yuv - Decoded key (intra) frames. Used to generate the side information at the decoder.
foreman_keyframe.cfg - Contains the mapping between the 8 quantisation matrix indices of the DISCOVER-codec and the quantisation parameter of the H.264/AVC codec to achieve similar PSNR results. Furthermore, the filenames of the decoded key frames and the corresponding PSNR results are defined.
foreman_psnr_data.txt - PSNR results and bitrates of each key and Wyner-Ziv frame. At the end, the average PSNR and the total bitrate are written.
leakybucketparam.cfg - Unused output from the H.264 Intra codec
log.dat - Unused output from the H.264 Intra codec
stats.dat - Unused output from the H.264 Intra codec
test.264 - Unused output from the H.264 Intra codec

Note:
The DISCOVER-codec writes ALL parity check bits into bitstream.wz. Rate control is achieved at the decoder, since the decoder does not use
all available parity bits.
